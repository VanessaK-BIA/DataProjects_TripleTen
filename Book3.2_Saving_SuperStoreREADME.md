PROJECT : 

Saving SuperStore.

Implementing my skills as a consultant to review the superstoreâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

GOAL : 

To review multiple area's of interest in order to ascertain what could be causing the losses before the company files for bankruptcy.

STARTING POINT :

The following categories are up for review :

- Profits and Losses ,

- Top 3 and Bottom 3 product categories ,

- Returns (Client based and Product based) ,

- Marketing trends (throughout each Month and across each State) ,

- Profits vs Averages.

We've discovered that: 
- the state responsible for the the most profits, is incurring pivotal losses ;
- the Bottom 3 product categories being returned at an increasing rate ,
- the Top 3 are selling fairly easily and with reliable consistency.
- the issue may be with quality and overall satisfaction.

The Bottom 3 Products are : 
- Bookcases, Supplies, and Tables.
- Tables are doing the worst , with the highest return rate.

The Top 3 Products are :
- Accessories, Copiers, and Phones.

From the data presented : 
- 4 customers are averaging between 11 and 14 returned items (which is way more than any other customer).
- Sales Revenue within this state can also be attributed to the marketing campaigns being launched.

CONCLUSION : 

The state that raked in the most revenue and allowed the Top 3 Categories to thrive, 
while also maintaining a steady and consistent marketing campaign for the Top 3 Categories is :
- California.
