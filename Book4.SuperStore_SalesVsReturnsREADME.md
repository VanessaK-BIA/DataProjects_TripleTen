PROJECT: 

SuperStore - Sales VS Returns Analysis 

For this project, we're going more in depth to really examine the Sales and Returns.

What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore? 

GOAL: 
Prepare an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to help them understand who / what is contributing to the high returns and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. 

STARTING POINT: 
- Find the categories with the most sales AND returns.
- Discover which customers are contributing to the higher return rates.

Based upon the findings: 

- Three categories have the highest return rates (Binders / Papers / Phones) ,
- Three customers are responsible for the high return rates in these three categories. 

Discovered the following : 
- West Coast region attributes not only to the highest density of sales but also is responsible for the highest return rates.
- California is the biggest benefactor for sales but also has the highest return rate out of all the regions. 

Interesting enough, the data also showed that :
- Returns are highest during three specific months (March / September / December).

CONCLUSION: 
- Opting to conduct more surveys during high return months will give SuperStore a better idea about return trends.
- Adopting newer return policies or modifying existing ones to curb the amount of frequent returns in any given year by customers.
